### LuFactor Algorithm
***
## Discrption 
* luFactor gives the L U and P of a given matrix 
%   Inputs: 
*            A - coefficent matrix   
#   Outputs: 
*            L- Lower triangular matrix
*            U- Upper trianguar matrix
*            P- Pivot matrix
# Known Bugs
1. Extra numbers in L
